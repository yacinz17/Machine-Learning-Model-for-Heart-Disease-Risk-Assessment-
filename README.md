# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease  
based on health metrics such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other clinical data.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find patterns and correlations.
- Model training using classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
